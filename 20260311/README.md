# Trail Traversal

Given an array of strings representing your trail map, return a string of the moves needed to get to your goal.

The given strings will contain the values:
"C": Your current location
"G": Your goal
"T": Traversable parts of the trail
"-": Untraversable parts of the map

Return a string with the moves needed to follow the trail from your location to your goal where:
"R" is a move right
"D" is a move down
"L" is a move left
"U" is a move up

There will always be a single continuous trail, without any branching, from your current location to your goal.
Each trail location will have a maximum of two traversable locations touching it.

For example, given:
[
  "-CT--",
  "--T--",
  "--TT-",
  "---T-",
  "---G-"
]
Return "RDDRDD".
