# Coffee Roast Detector
Given a string representing the beans used to make a cup of coffee, determine the roast of the cup.

The given string will contain the following characters, each representing a type of bean:

An apostrophe (') is a light roast bean worth 1 point each.
A dash (-) is a medium roast bean worth 2 points each.
A period (.) is a dark roast bean worth 3 points each.
The roast level is determined by the average of all the beans.

Return:

"Light" if the average is less than 1.75.
"Medium" if the average is 1.75 to 2.5.
"Dark" if the average is greater than 2.5.
