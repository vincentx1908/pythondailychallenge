My solutions to daily challenges on freecodecamp.org. 

I've been doing the freecodecamp.org daily challenges for a while and I think some of the challenge solutions are worth noting down, especially those I struggled a little bit at first or got my code purified/improved after consulting ChatGPT. These small challenges do help me improve my Python on a day to day basis.

Daily challenges on freecodecamp.org are really fun. Sometimes the challenges will be also relevant to things happening right now in the world. In the past month all challenges were related to the Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics.
